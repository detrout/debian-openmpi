openmpi (1.1-2.5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * High urgency upload for RC bugfix.
  * Add missing build-dependency on libsysfs-dev, which is used in the build
    but was previously pulled in via libibverbs-dev.

openmpi (1.1-2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * 0-day alpha porter upload.
  * Fix wrong inline assembler check on alpha: 'zero' is not recognized
    as a mnemonic for $31 with binutils.  This broken check resulted
    in various atomic operations remaining undefined, leading to a build
    failure on alpha.  Likewise, fix the inline assembly provided in
    opal/include/opal/sys/alpha/atomic.h so that it's valid under GNU
    binutils.  Closes: #384792.
