# Backport of SVN changesets 20317 and 20318. Will be in 1.3.1.
# We do not seem to need it currently, as the changes on Alpha do not need
# to re-run autotools. So we can drop this, and remove the "autogen" patch.
#vampirtrace

# Updated patch by Thiemo Seufer. Hopefully this will resolve #489173.
# If this works, it may be included upstream. (Unfortunately, it does not.
# We should wait for libtool 2.2 to get into unstable before trying again.)
#mips-support

# Backported bugfix that causes Open MPI to fail when running on localhost.
# This is changeset r20856 in upstream's SVN repo and will be included in
# the 1.3.2 release.
