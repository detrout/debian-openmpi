OpenMPI for Debian - Developer Notes
------------------------------------

MPI Alternatives
----------------

The current OpenMPI version of Debian uses the Debian Alternatives system.
Although OpenMPI might replace most of the existing MPI implementations in the
future (see http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=general#why), we decided to
not affect any other MPI implementation already installed on your system.

You can setup OpenMPI as default MPI implementation by selecting openmpi as
the "mpi" alternative:

  update-alternatives --config mpi

Please note that there are some bugs in update-alternatives (namely #220044,
#388313 and #392440) that cause trouble when you install several development
packages of MPI implementations, i.e. LAM or MPICH.
